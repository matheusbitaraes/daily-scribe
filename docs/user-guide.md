## Understanding Your Email Digest

### Digest Structure

Your daily email digest includes:

1. **Header Section**
   - Date of the digest
   - Number of articles included
   - Personalization summary

2. **Article Clusters**
   - Related articles grouped by topic
   - Cluster headlines describing the main theme
   - Individual article summaries within each cluster

3. **Footer Section**
   - Total article count
   - Sources included
   - Preference management link

### Article Information

Each article includes:
- **Headline:** Original article title
- **Summary:** AI-generated summary (1-2 paragraphs)
- **Source:** Publication name and date

### Clustering Logic

Articles are grouped when they:
- Cover the same breaking news story

- Share similar keywords or entities
- Come from the same event or announcement

## Tips for Best Results

### Optimizing Your Preferences

1. **Start broad, then narrow:** Begin with many sources and categories, then disable what you don't want
2. **Use specific keywords:** "machine learning" is better than just "AI"
3. **Review regularly:** Your interests might change over time
4. **Test with simulator:** Use the preview feature to see how changes affect your digest

### Managing Information Overload

1. **Limit high-volume sources** if your digest becomes too long
2. **Focus on specific categories** rather than enabling everything
3. **Use keywords strategically** to highlight priority topics
4. **Review and adjust** based on your actual reading habits

### Staying Informed

1. **Check preferences monthly** to ensure they still match your interests
2. **Experiment with new sources** occasionally
3. **Use the simulator** to catch up on days you missed
4. **Provide feedback** to your administrator about sources you'd like added
