# Creating Task Breakdown

Your task is to create a detailed development plan for a user story in this project.

## Context

You are working on the Daily Scribe project, which is a news aggregation and summarization application that:
- Fetches articles from RSS feeds
- Categorizes and clusters articles using AI
- Generates daily email digests with summaries
- Has a React frontend for article browsing
- Uses FastAPI backend with SQLite database
- Employs local LLM for content summarization

## Project Structure

```

## Your Task

Given a user story (provided separately), create a comprehensive task breakdown that includes:

### 1. Analysis Phase
- Review the user story requirements and acceptance criteria
- Identify all components that need to be created, modified, or integrated
- Determine dependencies between tasks
- Assess impact on existing codebase

### 2. Task Breakdown Structure

For each task, provide:

**Task Format:**
```
## Task [X]: [Brief Title]
**Type:** [Backend/Frontend/Testing/Documentation]
**Dependencies:** [List of prerequisite tasks]

### Description
[Detailed description of what needs to be done]

### Technical Details
- Specific files to create/modify
- API endpoints to implement
- Components to develop
- Integration points

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Specific, testable requirements
- [ ] Performance criteria
- [ ] Quality standards

### Notes/Considerations
- Edge cases to handle
- Potential challenges
- Alternative approaches
```

### 3. Implementation Phases

Organize tasks into logical phases:
- **Phase 1: Backend API Development**
- **Phase 2: Frontend Component Development** 
- **Phase 3: Integration & Testing**
- **Phase 4: Documentation & Cleanup**

### 4. Additional Considerations

Include sections for:

**Risk Assessment:**
- Technical risks and mitigation strategies
- Dependency risks
- Performance considerations

**Testing Strategy:**
- Unit tests needed
- Integration tests required
- Manual testing scenarios

**Documentation Updates:**
- API documentation
- User documentation
- Code comments

**Deployment Considerations:**
- Database migrations (if needed)
- Configuration changes
- Build process updates

## Output Format

Structure your response as a markdown document with:

1. **Executive Summary** - Brief overview of the implementation approach
2. **Task Breakdown** - Detailed tasks organized by phase
3. **Timeline** - Overall project timeline with milestones
4. **Resource Requirements** - Skills and tools needed
5. **Risk Assessment** - Potential challenges and mitigations
6. **Success Criteria** - How to measure completion

## Quality Standards

Ensure your task breakdown:
- ✅ Is specific and actionable
- ✅ Includes realistic time estimates
- ✅ Considers existing codebase integration
- ✅ Addresses both happy path and edge cases
- ✅ Includes comprehensive testing
- ✅ Maintains code quality standards
- ✅ Follows project architectural patterns

## Example Task Structure

```
## Task 1: Implement Digest Simulation API Endpoint
**Type:** Backend
**Priority:** High
**Estimated Time:** 4-6 hours
**Dependencies:** None

### Description
Create a new FastAPI endpoint that generates HTML digest content for a specified date and optional filters, using the existing DigestBuilder class to ensure consistency with email digests.

### Technical Details
- File to modify: `src/api.py`
- New endpoint: `GET /digest/simulate`
- Query parameters: date, category[], source_id[]
- Integration with: `DigestBuilder`, `DatabaseService`, `ArticleClusterer`
- Response format: JSON with HTML content and metadata

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Endpoint accepts date parameter in YYYY-MM-DD format
- [ ] Optional category and source_id filters work correctly
- [ ] Returns identical HTML to email digest generation
- [ ] Handles invalid dates gracefully
- [ ] Response time under 3 seconds for typical datasets
- [ ] Proper error handling and validation

### Notes/Considerations
- Reuse existing digest generation logic
- Consider caching for performance
- Validate date ranges against available articles
```

Remember to be thorough, practical, and consider the maintainability of the solution within the existing project architecture.

create a {index}_{user_story}.tasks.md inside folder `.specs/.tasks/`. If the file or folder doesn't exist, create it. Index is a 3 digit number starting from 001 and incrementing for each new user story.
