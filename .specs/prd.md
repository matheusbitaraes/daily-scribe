## Goals and Background Context

### Goals

- **Save Time:** Eliminate the need to manually browse multiple news websites daily.
- **Stay Informed:** Receive a daily, focused summary of news and updates on specific, user-defined topics.
- **Personalization:** Ensure the content is highly relevant by basing it on personal preferences.

### Background Context

The user wants to solve the problem of information fragmentation and the time-consuming nature of daily news consumption. Instead of visiting many different sources, the user desires a single, consolidated digest tailored to their interests. A key motivation is to undertake this as a personal project, with the technical constraint that it must be capable of running on a personal laptop, ideally leveraging a lightweight local LLM for processing.

### Functional Requirements

- **FR1:** The system must allow a user to provide a list of RSS feeds as news sources.
- **FR2:** The system shall fetch new articles from all provided RSS feeds on a daily schedule.
- **FR3:** For each fetched article, the system will generate a summary that is one to two paragraphs long.
- **FR4:** The system will aggregate all the summaries from a single day into one daily digest. The news should be aggregated by main topics.
- **FR5:** The system must be able to send the final digest to a user-configured 'to' email address.
- **FR6:** The system needs a way for the user to configure their 'to' email address and the list of RSS feeds.

### Non-Functional Requirements

- **NFR1:** The entire process of fetching, summarizing, and sending the daily digest should complete within a few minutes (e.g., under 5 minutes).
- **NFR2:** System configuration (RSS feeds, 'to' email address) will be managed through a simple JSON file.
- **NFR3:** The system must be able to run on a laptop with a consumer-grade GPU (e.g., Nvidia GTX 1650) and 32GB of RAM.
- **NFR4:** The project must utilize a lightweight LLM that is compatible with the hardware specified in NFR3.

## Technical Assumptions

### Repository Structure: Monorepo

The project will be contained within a single Git repository. This approach simplifies dependency management and version control for a self-contained application.

### Service Architecture: Monolith

The application will be built as a single, unified service (a monolith). This is the most straightforward architecture for this project, reducing deployment and operational complexity.
