# Elasticsearch Integration - Task Breakdown

## Executive Summary

This task breakdown outlines the implementation of Elasticsearch integration into the Daily Scribe news aggregation system. The implementation will provide advanced search capabilities, semantic similarity matching, personalized recommendations, and analytics while maintaining the existing SQLite database for transactional operations. The project follows a dual-database strategy where SQLite handles reliable transactions and Elasticsearch provides sophisticated search and analytics capabilities.

## Task Breakdown

- [x] Data persistence configured with Docker volumes
- [x] Environment variables properly configured
- [x] ES service integrates with existing docker-compose setup
- [x] Memory and CPU limits configured appropriately
- [x] Security settings configured (disabled for development)

### Notes/Considerations
- Start with single-node setup for development
- Consider production clustering requirements for future
- Ensure sufficient memory allocation (minimum 2GB)
- Plan for data backup and recovery procedures

## Task 4: Index Mappings and Configuration
**Type:** Backend
**Priority:** High
**Estimated Time:** 8-10 hours
**Dependencies:** Task 3

### Description
Create one index called daily_scribe_articles and one related mapping. This index will concatenate information from tables: articles, article_embeddings and sources

### Technical Details
- Create `src/config/elasticsearch_mappings.json` with all index definitions
- Implement index creation methods for each data type
- Add mapping validation and update functionality
- Implement index lifecycle management

### Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Articles index mapping with embedding support (1536 dimensions)
- [ ] User preferences index mapping with personalization fields
- [ ] Article clusters index mapping for topic analysis
- [ ] Search analytics index mapping for usage tracking
- [x] Index creation methods for all mappings
- [x] Mapping validation and error handling
- [ ] Index template configuration
- [ ] Version control for mapping changes
- [x] Documentation for each index structure

### Notes/Considerations
- Design mappings for optimal search performance
- Consider analyzer configuration for different languages
- Plan for mapping evolution and updates
- Ensure embedding field configuration supports cosine similarity

---

### Phase 2: Data Migration & Synchronization

## Task 5: Data Migration Infrastructure
**Type:** Backend
**Priority:** High
**Estimated Time:** 10-12 hours
**Dependencies:** Task 4

### Description
add sync-search-db command into main.py script and infrastructure to transfer existing SQLite data to Elasticsearch while preserving embeddings and relationships. There should be 2 options: full and partial. 'full' will reindex everything based on what is in sqlite. 'partial' will check only what was not yet synced

### Technical Details
- Create `src/migrations/elasticsearch_migration.py`
- Implement batch processing for large datasets
- Add progress tracking and resumable migrations
- Create validation scripts to verify data integrity
- Implement rollback capabilities
- Add performance monitoring and optimization

### Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Migration script for articles with embeddings
- [x] Migration script for user preferences  
- [x] Batch processing with configurable batch sizes
- [x] Progress tracking with detailed logging
- [x] Data validation and integrity checks
