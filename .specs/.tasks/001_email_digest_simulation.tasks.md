# Task Breakdown: Email Digest Simulation Frontend

**User Story:** Email Digest Simulation and Preview Page  
**Created:** September 4, 2025  
**Estimated Total Time:** 6-8 days

---

## Executive Summary

This task breakdown implements a frontend page that allows users to simulate and preview email digests for any date. The implementation follows a four-phase approach: backend API development, frontend component creation, integration testing, and documentation. The solution leverages existing digest generation logic while adding new preview capabilities and historical date support.

**Key Deliverables:**
- 3 new FastAPI endpoints for digest simulation
- 5 new React components for the simulator interface
- Integration with existing DigestBuilder and clustering logic
- Comprehensive testing suite
- Updated navigation and routing
