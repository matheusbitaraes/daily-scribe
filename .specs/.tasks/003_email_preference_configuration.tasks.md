# Task Breakdown: Email Preference Configuration

## Executive Summary

This project implements a secure email preference configuration system that allows Daily Scribe users to customize their digest content through categories, sources, and keywords. The solution uses an enhanced token-based security approach with device fingerprinting and usage limits to ensure secure access while maintaining a frictionless user experience.

**Key Components:**
- Secure token management system with JWT and device fingerprinting
- Database schema for token metadata storage
- RESTful API endpoints for preference management
- React frontend for preference configuration
- Email template integration with secure access buttons

**Implementation Approach:**
The project follows a security-first approach with multi-layered token validation, immediate persistence of changes, and comprehensive audit logging. The frontend provides a responsive, accessible interface that works seamlessly across desktop and mobile devices.
